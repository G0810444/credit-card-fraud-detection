# 🕵️‍♂️ Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project uses real-world credit card transaction data to detect fraudulent activity using machine learning models. The goal is to identify fraud with high precision and interpret the factors behind fraudulent behavior using explainability tools like SHAP.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Credit card fraud causes billions in losses annually. The challenge is detecting fraudulent transactions in real-time despite massive class imbalance — fraud is rare, but costly. This project builds a predictive model that flags suspicious transactions and explains why.
